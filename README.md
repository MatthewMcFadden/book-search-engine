## To Start this app locally
Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3001. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
